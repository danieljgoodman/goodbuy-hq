## Agent Specialization Guide

### When to Use Each Agent

| Situation | Agent | Command | Expected Output |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Project inception | Analyst | `*agent analyst` | Project brief, market research |
| Feature definition | PM | `*agent pm` | PRD, requirements, epics |
| UI/UX design | UX-Expert | `*agent ux-expert` | UI specs, design prompts |
| Technical architecture | Architect | `*agent architect` | System design, tech stack |
| Document validation | PO | `*agent po` | Quality checks, sharding |
| Story creation | SM | `@sm *create` | User stories, acceptance criteria |
| Code implementation | Dev | `@dev` | Production code with tests |
| Quality assurance | QA | `@qa *review` | Quality gates, test strategies |
| General tasks | BMad-Master | `*agent bmad-master` | Any non-implementation task |

## Quality Gate Quick Commands

### QA Agent Commands
```bash
@qa *risk story-X-X      # Risk assessment
@qa *design story-X-X    # Test design strategy  
@qa *trace story-X-X     # Requirements traceability
@qa *review story-X-X    # Comprehensive quality review
@qa *nfr story-X-X       # Non-functional requirements check
```

### Quality Gate Statuses
- **‚úÖ PASS** - Ready for production
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERNS** - Minor issues, team review recommended  
- **‚ùå FAIL** - Critical issues, must address before proceeding
- **üîÑ WAIVED** - Issues accepted, document reasoning

## Template System Quick Reference

### Available Templates
```bash
*template list                    # Show all templates
*template prd-template-v2        # Product requirements document
*template fullstack-architecture  # System architecture
*template ui-specification       # Frontend specifications  
*template user-story            # Story template
*template quality-checklist     # QA checklists
```

### Template Elicitation Options (1-9 Selection)

## Claude Code Integration Patterns

### Parallel Agent Spawning
```javascript
// Single message with concurrent agent execution
Task("BMAD Analyst", "Research requirements for [feature]. Store in memory key 'project/analysis'", "analyst")
Task("BMAD Architect", "Design architecture for [feature]. Check memory for analysis", "architect") 
Task("BMAD QA", "Develop test strategy for [feature]. Coordinate via hooks", "qa")

TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {content: "Research market requirements", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Researching market requirements"},
    {content: "Design system architecture", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Designing system architecture"},
    {content: "Create test strategy", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Creating test strategy"}
  ]
})
```

### Coordination Hooks (Each Agent)
```bash
# Pre-task
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[task-description]"

# During work
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file-path]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"

# Post-task  
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task-id]"
```

## Common Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Agent not responding
*status                 # Check current state
*agent bmad-orchestrator # Reset to orchestrator

# Context overflow
@po "Please shard documents"  # Reduce context size
*yolo                  # Enable rapid mode

# Quality gate failures
@qa *trace story-X-X   # Check test coverage
@dev "Address QA concerns from latest review"
```

### Emergency Commands
```bash
*agent bmad-master *task correct-course  # Analyze and correct project issues
*checklist po-master-checklist          # Comprehensive validation
*exit                                   # Return to orchestrator from any agent
```

## Performance Optimization

### Rapid Development Mode
```bash
*yolo                    # Skip confirmation prompts
*task create-stories epic-1 epic-2  # Batch story creation
*workflow [name] --fast  # Skip elicitation where possible
```

### Context Management
```bash
# Efficient file structure
docs/core/              # Always-loaded architecture files
docs/current/           # Active development files
docs/archive/           # Completed work
```

## Success Metrics to Track

### Development Velocity
- Time from concept to working prototype
- Stories completed per sprint
- Quality gate pass rate

### Code Quality  
- Test coverage percentage (target: 85%+)
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security vulnerability count (target: 0 critical)

### Documentation Quality
