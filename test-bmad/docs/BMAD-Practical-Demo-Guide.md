## Part 3: Agent Coordination Patterns

### 3.1 Sequential Agent Handoffs

**Classic Workflow Pattern:**
```
Web UI Environment:
*agent analyst → *agent pm → *agent ux-expert → *agent architect → *agent po

IDE Environment:  
@po (document sharding) → @sm (story creation) → @dev (implementation) → @qa (review)
```

### 3.2 Parallel Agent Coordination with Claude Code

**Using Claude Code's Task Tool for Concurrent Execution:**

```javascript
// Single message with parallel agent spawning via Claude Code's Task tool
Task("BMAD Research Agent", "Analyze AI recommendation algorithms and best practices for e-commerce. Focus on collaborative filtering vs content-based approaches. Store findings in memory for other agents.", "analyst")

Task("BMAD UX Agent", "Design user interface patterns for recommendation displays. Create mobile-first responsive designs. Consider accessibility requirements and loading states.", "ux-expert")

Task("BMAD Architecture Agent", "Design scalable system architecture for real-time recommendations. Include caching strategies, API design, and database optimization. Check memory for research insights.", "architect")

Task("BMAD QA Agent", "Develop comprehensive test strategy for recommendation systems. Include performance testing, A/B testing framework, and quality metrics. Coordinate with other agents via hooks.", "qa")

// Batch all todos in one call
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {content: "Research recommendation algorithms", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Researching recommendation algorithms"},
    {content: "Design recommendation UI components", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Designing recommendation UI components"}, 
    {content: "Architect recommendation system", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Architecting recommendation system"},
    {content: "Create testing strategy", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Creating testing strategy"},
    {content: "Document integration patterns", status: "pending", activeForm: "Documenting integration patterns"},
    {content: "Validate performance requirements", status: "pending", activeForm: "Validating performance requirements"},
    {content: "Review security implications", status: "pending", activeForm: "Reviewing security implications"},
    {content: "Plan deployment strategy", status: "pending", activeForm: "Planning deployment strategy"}
  ]
})
```

### 3.3 Agent Coordination Hooks

**Every spawned agent should implement coordination hooks:**

```bash
# Pre-task coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Implementing recommendation algorithm"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "goodbuy-recommendations"

# During implementation
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "src/lib/recommendations/collaborative-filtering.ts" --memory-key "swarm/dev/algorithm-implementation"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "Recommendation algorithm core implementation complete"

# Post-task coordination  
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "story-1-1"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

// MCP tools set up coordination topology (optional for complex workflows)
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init({
  topology: "mesh",
  maxAgents: 10,
  coordination: "bmad-orchestrated"
})

mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
  type: "bmad-orchestrator",
  role: "master-coordinator"
})

mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
  type: "analyst",

Post-task: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "qa-recommendations"
`, "qa")
```

### 6.2 Agent Coordination Hooks Implementation

**In each spawned agent's workflow:**

```bash
# Pre-work coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[specific-task-description]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "goodbuy-bmad-workflow"

# During work (after each significant step)
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file-path]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent-role]/[task-step]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "[progress-update]"

# Inter-agent coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "shared/[topic]" --value "[shared-data]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-retrieve --key "shared/[topic]"

# Post-work coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task-identifier]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

## Part 7: Troubleshooting Guide

### 7.1 Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Agent Activation Failure**
```
Error: "BMad Orchestrator not responding to commands"

Solution:
1. Verify activation message format: "Activate as BMad Orchestrator..."
2. Check if core configuration files are accessible
3. Try explicit agent loading: *agent bmad-orchestrator
4. Clear conversation and restart with fresh activation

Debug Commands:
*status        # Check current agent state
*help          # Verify command availability  
*agent list    # Show available agents
```

**Issue: Context Overflow**
```
Error: "Context limit exceeded during document processing"

Solution:
1. Use PO agent for document sharding: @po "Please shard documents"
2. Process epics sequentially instead of all at once
3. Use YOLO mode for rapid iteration: *yolo
4. Clear conversation and continue from sharded documents

Prevention:
- Shard documents after architecture phase
- Keep individual stories under 2000 words
- Use reference links instead of full content inclusion
```

**Issue: Quality Gate Failures**
```  
Error: "QA review returns FAIL status consistently"

Solution:
1. Review acceptance criteria completeness: @qa *trace story-X-X
2. Check test coverage requirements: Target 85%+ unit tests  
3. Address security and performance concerns systematically
4. Use incremental validation: *nfr before full *review

Quality Recovery Process:
@dev "Address QA concerns from latest review"
@qa *review story-X-X  # Re-run after fixes
Document waived items if business accepts risk
```

**Issue: Agent Coordination Conflicts**
```
Error: "Agents producing inconsistent outputs"

Solution:
1. Ensure proper handoff messages between agents
2. Use shared context loading: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
3. Implement coordination hooks for MCP/Claude Code integration
4. Return to BMad Orchestrator for conflict resolution: *agent bmad-orchestrator

Coordination Checklist:
- [ ] Proper pre-task hooks executed
- [ ] Memory keys used for shared data
- [ ] Post-task coordination completed
- [ ] Session metrics exported
```

### 7.2 Performance Optimization

**Rapid Prototyping Mode:**
```bash
*yolo  # Enable skip-confirmation mode
*workflow greenfield-fullstack
# Processes all template sections without elicitation stops
# 3-5x faster for iteration cycles
```

**Batch Processing:**
```bash
*task create-stories epic-1 epic-2 epic-3
# Generates multiple stories simultaneously
# Reduces context switching overhead
```

**Context Management:**
```bash
# Efficient file organization
docs/
├── core/           # Always-loaded files
├── current/        # Active work files  
├── archive/        # Completed work
└── reference/      # Background information
```

### 7.3 Best Practices Summary

1. **Phase Separation:** Planning (Web UI) → Development (IDE)
2. **Context Loading:** Use architecture files as context base
3. **Quality Gates:** Regular QA checkpoints prevent rework
4. **Agent Specialization:** Use appropriate agent for each task
5. **Coordination Hooks:** Implement MCP/Claude Code integration
6. **Documentation:** Maintain decision records and handoff notes
