# Story 1.1: Database Schema Extensions

## Status

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**

No previous story exists - this is the first story in the epic.

### **Database Architecture Context**

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#data-models-and-apis]

**Current Database Setup:**

- PostgreSQL 14+ database with Prisma ORM 6.14.0
- Schema-first approach using `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Existing comprehensive business model with 20+ related models
- Current Business model has extensive fields including financial data (revenue, profit, ebitda, cashFlow, etc.)

**Database Patterns to Follow:**

- Use `cuid()` for primary keys (existing pattern from User and Business models)
- Include `createdAt DateTime @default(now())` and `updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt` for all models
- Follow existing naming conventions: camelCase for fields, PascalCase for models
- Use `@@map("table_name")` with snake_case table names (e.g., `@@map("health_metrics")`)
- Foreign key relationships use singular model name + "Id" (e.g., `businessId String`)

### **Data Models Specifications**

[Source: docs/AI_FINANCIAL_HEALTH_ANALYZER_PRD.md#database-schema-extensions]

**Required Health Metrics Fields:**

- `overall_score INTEGER CHECK (overall_score >= 0 AND overall_score <= 100)`
- `growth_score INTEGER`, `operational_score INTEGER`, `financial_score INTEGER`, `sale_readiness_score INTEGER`
- `confidence_level INTEGER CHECK (confidence_level >= 0 AND confidence_level <= 100)`
- `trajectory health_trajectory_enum DEFAULT 'stable'`
- `calculated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- `data_sources JSONB`, `calculation_metadata JSONB`

**Required Forecast Fields:**

- `forecast_type forecast_type_enum` (revenue, expenses, profit, cash_flow, growth_rate)
- `forecast_period INTEGER` (months ahead)
- `predicted_value DECIMAL(15,2)`
- `confidence_interval_lower DECIMAL(15,2)`, `confidence_interval_upper DECIMAL(15,2)`
- `confidence_score INTEGER`, `model_used VARCHAR(50)`
- `actual_value DECIMAL(15,2)` (populated when actual data becomes available)

**Required QuickBooks Connection Fields:**

- `company_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`
- `access_token_encrypted TEXT`, `refresh_token_encrypted TEXT`
- `token_expires_at TIMESTAMP`, `last_sync_at TIMESTAMP`
- `sync_status sync_status_enum DEFAULT 'pending'`
- `sync_errors JSONB`, `webhook_subscriptions JSONB`

**Required Health Alert Fields:**

- `alert_type alert_type_enum`, `severity alert_severity_enum`
- `title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL`, `description TEXT`
- `threshold_value DECIMAL(10,2)`, `actual_value DECIMAL(10,2)`
- `triggered_at TIMESTAMP`, `acknowledged_at TIMESTAMP`, `resolved_at TIMESTAMP`
- `metadata JSONB`

### **Enum Definitions Required**

[Source: docs/AI_FINANCIAL_HEALTH_ANALYZER_PRD.md#database-schema-extensions]

```sql
CREATE TYPE health_trajectory AS ENUM ('improving', 'stable', 'declining', 'volatile');
CREATE TYPE forecast_type_enum AS ENUM ('revenue', 'expenses', 'profit', 'cash_flow', 'growth_rate');
CREATE TYPE sync_status_enum AS ENUM ('pending', 'syncing', 'completed', 'error');
CREATE TYPE alert_type_enum AS ENUM ('score_drop', 'forecast_alert', 'data_anomaly', 'threshold_breach');
CREATE TYPE alert_severity_enum AS ENUM ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical');
```

### **Index Requirements**

[Source: docs/AI_FINANCIAL_HEALTH_ANALYZER_PRD.md#database-schema-extensions]

- `idx_health_metrics_business_date` on (businessId, calculatedAt DESC)
- `idx_forecast_results_business_type` on (businessId, forecastType)
- `idx_quickbooks_connections_company` on (companyId)
- `idx_health_alerts_business_severity` on (businessId, severity, triggeredAt DESC)

### **File Locations**

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#critical-files]

- **Schema File**: `prisma/schema.prisma` - Main database schema file to modify
- **Migration Directory**: `prisma/migrations/` - Auto-generated migration files will be created here
- **Type Definitions**: New Prisma types will be auto-generated in `node_modules/.prisma/client/`

### **Technical Constraints**

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#technical-debt-and-constraints]

- Database changes must be additive-only (no breaking changes to existing models)
- All foreign key relationships must reference existing models correctly
- Must follow existing Prisma patterns for enum definitions and field validation
- PostgreSQL-specific features can be used as established in existing schema

### **Testing Standards**

**Test Requirements:**

- Verify migration runs successfully without errors
- Test that existing business data remains accessible after migration
- Validate foreign key constraints work correctly
- Test that new models can be queried through Prisma client
- Verify rollback migration works correctly

**Test File Locations:**

- No specific test framework identified in architecture docs - manual testing through Prisma Studio and database queries
- Prisma migration testing through `prisma migrate dev` and `prisma db push`

### **Project Structure Notes**

[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#source-tree-and-module-organization]

The schema changes align with existing project structure:

- Database schema centralized in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Migration files auto-generated in `prisma/migrations/`
- TypeScript types will be auto-generated and available throughout application

No structural conflicts identified - this follows established Prisma ORM patterns.
