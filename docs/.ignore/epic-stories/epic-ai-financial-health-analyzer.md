2. **Data Privacy & Security**
   - **Mitigation**: Follow established security patterns, encrypt sensitive data
   - **Validation**: Security audit before production deployment

3. **Performance Impact on Existing System**
   - **Mitigation**: Implement efficient caching, background processing
   - **Monitoring**: Continuous performance monitoring and alerting

4. **Forecasting Accuracy Below Target (85%)**
   - **Mitigation**: Ensemble models, continuous learning from actual results
   - **Fallback**: Clear communication of confidence levels to users

### Rollback Plan

## Dependencies & Sequencing

### Critical Path

1. **Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2** (database foundation required)
2. **Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3** (data sync required for scoring)
3. **Phase 3 must complete before Phase 4** (scores needed for dashboard)
4. **Phases 4 & 5 can partially overlap** (dashboard can show basic scores while forecasting is developed)

### External Dependencies

- QuickBooks developer account and API access
- OpenAI API continued availability (existing dependency)
- Database migration coordination with existing data

### Technical Dependencies

- All new code must be compatible with existing TypeScript/Next.js 14 setup
