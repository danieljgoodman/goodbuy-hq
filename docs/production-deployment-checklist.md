## API Endpoints Verification

### Required Endpoints

- [ ] `GET /api/businesses` - Fetch user's businesses (✅ implemented)
- [ ] `GET /api/businesses/[businessId]` - Fetch specific business data
- [ ] `GET /api/health/[businessId]` - Fetch existing health data
- [ ] `POST /api/health/calculate` - Trigger health calculation
- [ ] `GET /api/health/[businessId]/history` - Historical health data (optional)

### API Testing Commands

```bash
# Test business listing
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3001/api/businesses

# Test health calculation endpoint
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"businessId":"<id>"}' \
  http://localhost:3001/api/health/calculate

# Test health data retrieval
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/health/<businessId>
```

## Database Verification

### Required Tables

- [ ] `businesses` - Business information exists
- [ ] `business_health` - Health scoring data table
- [ ] `business_health_history` - Historical tracking (optional)
- [ ] User authentication tables (existing)

### Database Schema Check

```sql
-- Verify business_health table exists
DESCRIBE business_health;

-- Check sample data exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM businesses WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM business_health;
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<production-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=<production-url>

# Database
DATABASE_URL=<production-database-url>

# Health Calculation API (if external)
HEALTH_API_URL=<health-api-endpoint>
HEALTH_API_KEY=<api-key>

# Optional: OpenAI for insights
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai-key>
```

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check environment variables are loaded
npm run build && node -e "console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL ? 'DB Connected' : 'DB Missing')"
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Deployment

```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
npm ci --production

# Build application
npm run build

# Run production build
npm start
```

### 2. Database Migration (if needed)

```bash
# Run Prisma migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Verify database connection
npx prisma db push --preview-feature
```

### 3. Health Check Verification

```bash
# Check application is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health-check

# Verify authentication endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/providers

# Test business API with valid session
curl -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=<token>" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/businesses
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### UI/UX Testing

- [ ] Navigate to `/financial-health` from main navigation
- [ ] Business selection page loads correctly
- [ ] "Analyze Health" button navigates to health dashboard
- [ ] Health dashboard displays with sample data
- [ ] All charts and visualizations render properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works correctly

### Functional Testing

- [ ] User authentication flow works
- [ ] Business filtering and selection functional
- [ ] Health calculation triggers successfully
- [ ] Error handling displays user-friendly messages
- [ ] Loading states show appropriately
- [ ] Export functionality works (if implemented)

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Chart rendering < 2 seconds
- [ ] API response times < 1 second
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits

## Monitoring & Logging Setup

### Error Tracking

```bash
# Setup error monitoring (example with Sentry)
npm install @sentry/nextjs
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Setup performance monitoring
npm install @vercel/analytics
```

### Logging Configuration

```javascript
// Add to health dashboard pages for production logging
console.log('Health dashboard accessed:', {
  businessId,
  userId: session?.user?.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
})
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback Steps

```bash
# 1. Stop current deployment
pm2 stop goodbuy-hq

# 2. Switch to previous version
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# 3. Rebuild and restart
npm run build
pm2 start goodbuy-hq

# 4. Verify rollback successful
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health-check
```

### Database Rollback

```bash
# If database changes need rollback
npx prisma migrate reset --preview-feature
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Security Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization
