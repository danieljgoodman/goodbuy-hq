## Theme Integration

### Dark/Light Mode Support

- **Automatic theme detection** based on system preferences
- **Manual toggle** capability
- **Consistent colors** across themes using CSS variables
- **Proper contrast** maintained in both modes

### Color System

```css
/* Light Theme */
--primary: #c96442 /* Brand primary */ --success: #10b981
  /* Success/positive metrics */ --warning: #f59e0b
  /* Warning/attention needed */ --error: #ef4444 /* Error/critical issues */
  /* Chart Colors */ --chart-1: #b05730 /* Primary chart color */
  --chart-2: #9c87f5 /* Secondary chart color */ --chart-3: #ded8c4
  /* Tertiary chart color */;
```

## Error Handling & Loading States

### 1. Progressive Loading

- **Skeleton screens** during initial data fetch
- **Incremental rendering** as data becomes available
- **Smooth transitions** between loading and loaded states

### 2. Error Recovery

- **User feedback** when limits are reached
- **Intelligent caching** to reduce API calls

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **Session-based authentication** required for all endpoints
- **Business ownership validation** before data access
- **CSRF protection** on all mutations
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### 2. Data Privacy

- **No sensitive data logging** in client-side code
- **Secure API endpoints** with proper validation
- **User data isolation** by business ownership
