# Template and Framework Selection

## Existing Project Foundation Detected

Your GoodBuy HQ project is built on **Next.js 14.2.32** with **React 18.3.1** and **TypeScript 5.7.2**, representing a mature, production-ready codebase with:

- **Comprehensive ShadCN UI component library** with Radix UI primitives
- **Professional styling system** using Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 with established colors.md theming
- **Advanced data visualization** with Chart.js, Recharts, and D3-scale
- **Real-time capabilities** via Socket.IO already integrated
- **Enterprise-grade authentication** using NextAuth.js with Prisma adapter
- **Professional tooling** with comprehensive testing, linting, and type checking

**Framework Decision:** âœ… **Continue with existing Next.js 14 App Router** - No starter template needed as you have a sophisticated brownfield application.

**Brownfield Integration Constraints:**
1. Must maintain existing ShadCN UI component patterns and Radix UI foundations
2. Must preserve established Tailwind CSS configuration and theme system
3. Must integrate with existing authentication, database, and real-time infrastructure
4. Must maintain backward compatibility for current users and workflows
