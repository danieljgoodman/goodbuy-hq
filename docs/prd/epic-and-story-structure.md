# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single Comprehensive Epic with Phase-Based Implementation** 

**Rationale**: Based on analysis of existing project architecture and comprehensive AI MVP requirements, this enhancement should be structured as **one major epic with four sequential phases** rather than separate epics. This approach is optimal for brownfield enhancement because:

1. **Architectural Interdependence**: All AI SaaS features share common infrastructure (authentication, database, UI components) that must be enhanced cohesively
2. **Data Model Integration**: Subscription management, user roles, and AI analysis features require coordinated database schema changes
3. **User Experience Continuity**: Phased rollout allows existing users to gradually adopt enhanced features without workflow disruption
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Single epic enables comprehensive testing and validation while maintaining existing functionality integrity
